# Description

The aim of this project is to defined an API capable of retrieving and storing data related to a store.

For this project I used the following technologies:

1. Docker: To serve my MicrosoftSQLServer database.
2. Flask: As a framework to create my web application.
3. Marshmellow: To serialize the data.
4. SQLAlchemy: To connect with the relational database and to use the ORM.
5. SWagger: For documentation.
6. unittest: To test the code logic.
7. flask extensions (i.e. flask_restful).
